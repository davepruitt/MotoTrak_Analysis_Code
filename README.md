# MotoTrak_Analysis_Code

These are the core analysis files that I have written to do the majority of my data analysis for MotoTrak. Let me stress that these are not all the files by any stretch - rather these are just the core files.

These files will allow you to load MotoTrak data into Matlab. The code also performs a basic analysis of all of the data and puts the data into a simply structured format that is easy to use and make plots from.

The coding was performed in Matlab, and all questions should be directed towards David Pruitt.
